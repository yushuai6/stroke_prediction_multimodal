# stroke_prediction_multimodal
A deep learning framework for predicting 90-day post-stroke functional outcomes (mRS 0–2 vs. 3–6) using multimodal data integration. The pipeline combines non-contrast CT, multimodal MRI sequences (DWI, ADC, FLAIR), and structured clinical variables through late-fusion 3D ResNet models and machine-learning classifiers.
